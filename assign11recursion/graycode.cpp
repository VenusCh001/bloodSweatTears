//Given the Binary code of a number as a decimal number, we need to convert this into its
//equivalent Gray Code. In gray code, only one bit is changed in 2 consecutive numbers.
//Hint: The Most Significant Bit (MSB) of the gray code is always equal to the MSB of the given
//binary code and other bits of the output gray code can be obtained by XORing binary code bit at
//that index and previous index.
